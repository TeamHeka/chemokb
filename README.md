# ChemoKB and ChemoKB-open
ChemoKB is a a knowledge graph of chemotherapy protocols. A subset of ChemoKB, named ChemoKB-open, includes only non-confidential protocols (513 out of 1,358).
These protocols have been extracted from the Pharmacy database of the Georges Pompidou Eureopean Hospital (HEGP) of the AP-HP. 

ChemoKB-open will soon be available at https://chemokb.inria.fr/, with a SPARQL endpoint.
ChemoKB-open is available for download at XX.
ChemoKB is described in more details in [1]

ChemoKB instanciates the ChemoOnto ontology [2, 3].
